As shown in the slideshow, you need to have proper DNS records set up. Say that you want to receive emails for the
`example.com` domain. If some other mail server on the internet wants to send an email to your server, it looks for two
records:

- **MX record (`example.com`)**  
  The MX (Mail Exchange) record tells other mail servers _where to deliver emails_ for the domain `example.com`.  
  Instead of pointing directly to an IP address, it points to a **hostname** (for example, `smtp.example.com`).  
  MX records also include a **priority value**. If multiple mail servers are listed, the one with the lowest priority
  number is tried first. Others are used as fallback if the first is unavailable.

- **A / AAAA record (`smtp.example.com`)**  
  The hostname specified in the MX record (`smtp.example.com`) must resolve to an IP address so that other mail servers
  know how to reach it.
  - An **A record** maps the hostname to an IPv4 address.
  - An **AAAA record** maps the hostname to an IPv6 address.

  Once resolved, the sending mail server connects to that IP address on **TCP port 25**, which is the standard port for
  email delivery (SMTP).

<Aside>

If no MX record is found, the remote mail server will instead directly look for an A or AAAA record of `example.com`.

<Aside type="caution">

The MX record must point to a hostname. It **must not** point to an IP address directly.

</Aside>

In zone syntax you would create something like:

```
@ IN MX 10 smtp
smtp IN A 100.64.17.3
smtp IN AAAA fd7a:115c:a1e0::17
```

If possible, also add a PTR record that makes the IP addresses point back to the name `smtp.example.com`. Other mail
servers may be more likely so flag your sent emails as spam if you do not have a PTR record. Preferable the forward
(A/AAAA) and reverse (PTR) records match.

<Aside icon="approve-check-circle" title="Test it">

Use the `host` command to check your domain's MX record.

```sh title="Example"
dig +short example.com mx
# 10 smtp.example.com.
```

Then check if that result resolves to an IP address:

```sh title="Example"
dig +short smtp.example.com a
# 49.13.89.249
dig +short smtp.example.com aaaa
# 2a01:4f8:c012:62d1::1
```

Preferably the IP addresses should resolve back to the mail server's name:

```sh title="Example"
dig +short -x 49.13.89.249
# smtp.example.com.
dig +short -x 2a01:4f8:c012:62d1::1
# smtp.example.com.
```
