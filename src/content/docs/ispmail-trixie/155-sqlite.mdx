Your mail server must know which domains and email addresses it is responsible for, so it can reject spam sent to
non-existent users. That information will be put into an SQLite database file that will be located at
`/var/vmail/ispmail.sqlite`.

<Aside title="What is SQLite?">
  SQLite is a lightweight, relational database that stores data in tables with rows and columns, just like bigger
  database systems such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Unlike those, it doesn’t need a permanently running server process —
  instead, it’s just a library your application uses directly, storing everything in a single file. This makes it easy
  to set up, fast, and ideal for small projects.
