Your mail server will use multiple pieces of software to do its job. I have created a little slideshow to help you
understand what happens when someone on the internet sends an email to your server. I will provide more slideshows later
when it comes to fetching and relaying emails. Use the arrows to switch between slides:

<Splide>
  {Array.from({ length: 24 }, (_, i) => i + 1).map((i) => (
    <SplideSlide>
      <img src={`/big-picture-receive/${String(i).padStart(2, "0")}.svg`} alt={`Slide ${i}`} />
    </SplideSlide>
  ))}
</Splide>

So:

- DNS is used to find your mail server
- Postfix receives emails using SMTP (the Simple Mail Transport Protocol)
- SQLite stores information about your domains and mail users
- rspamd checks if it is spam
- Dovecot saves it to disk
