I have created a slideshow to help you understand the process of receiving an email from a remote mail server. Hopefully
it helps to get a better understanding of the steps involved in receiving email. We will prepare the necessary
configuration in the next chapters.

Use the arrows to navigate between slides:

<Splide>
  {Array.from({ length: 24 }, (_, i) => i + 1).map((i) => (
    <SplideSlide key={i}>
      <img src={`/big-picture-receive/${String(i).padStart(2, "0")}.svg`} alt={`Slide ${i}`} />
    </SplideSlide>
  ))}
</Splide>
