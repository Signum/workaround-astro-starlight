If you want to set up multiple mail servers then automation is your friend. Nowadays [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) is commonly used for that purpose. If you are dealing with system administration you should have such a tool in your toolbox.

I have created an [Ansible playbook on Github](https://github.com/Signum/ispmail-bookworm-ansible) that you can download and use. Using it is pretty simple:

```
apt install ansible git
git clone https://github.com/Signum/ispmail-bookworm-ansible.git
cd ispmail-bookworm-ansible/ansible
ansible-playbook ispmail.yml -c local
```

Please follow the hints in the README.md within the repository.
