## What readers say

- Kostja:

	I have been using the workaround.org ISPMAIL tutorials for many years and still do it every time I upgrade my mailserver. It is a neat and straightforward approach and saves me a lot of time I otherwise would have to spend reading manuals, finding new packages and trying things out. Everything is on the point and I get the information I need, that‚Äôs perfect. Thank you very much for you great work.

- David:

	I just finished setting up my ~fifth ispmail server (squeeze, 2x stretch, now bullseye) and this time I didn‚Äôt even bother to do the recommended checks after each step because I knew that after following (and unterstanding) your tutorial, the server would go like a Swiss watch. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Everything works and again I learned a lot. Thank you for putting that much effort into the tutorials!

- Yannis:

	Just wanted to say thanks for your amazing work. Not only proved up to date and accurate technically, but it is also presented in a very educational way. It really is high-quality learning material.

- Ezerotszaz:

	I‚Äôm finally done setting up two of these mail servers ‚Äì for myself and also for a friend.
	I struggled a lot when I was doing it for the first time, but after days of work it is done, it is working properly, I can send(and receive..) from four different addresses and I could not be happier!
	Thank you so much for the insane amount of work that you put into this awesome guide.	

- Impli:

	It had been a long time since I had installed a mail server and the few tutorials I could find were not explicit.
	But your guide is very well done. Complete and very detailed. With even some technical information as a bonus for the curious.

- Niko:

	I really like this guide. I was able to learn some new stuff and setup a nice configured server. I now have a server running 2 domains and several user accounts. It took me a few evenings of my spare time and i think it was worth it. Thank you very much for your guidance!

- Michael:

	Great guide! Thanks! Very structured and clear! It took me about 2 hours to have a fully funktional email server including ISPmail on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2 with Raspbian GNU/Linux 11. 

- David:

	Thank you so very much Christoph. I now have a successful mail server running on Linode, and it has all the pieces you have detailed here. It works very well. Best of all, I understand how the pieces hang together.

- Shukuru:

	This guide is pure gold. As a professional developer with some sysadmin skills I was able to set up my first email server in a week.
	I learn a lot about how emails works and I can now take control on my privacy. Thanks.

- Panos:

	I am proud to be able to thank the author of this series of Guides publicly, for all the unbelievable work he has done, all these years. To anyone wishing to truly understand what running a mail server is about, this is the proper place to be.

- Cody:

	Seen this guide a few times before and found it to be the most comprehensive one available.

- Anthony:

	Thanks again for such a comprehensive guide. I‚Äôve been using it for several years and I appreciate the updates for the new versions.
	I just did a ‚Äúspeed run‚Äù on a test mail server/domain and it took about 2 hours. TLS/DKIM/SPF are all passing too! I‚Äôve gotten a lot of practice with your guide over the last few versions, so I would hope that I can complete it quickly.

- James:

	Thanks Christoph, For your work running this site and the ISPmail guides. I‚Äôve been following them for each Debian release since Wheezy.
	I use my mail server primarily for my personal email address and also have a handful of friends using it. Works great.

- Robbert:

	I have been using this guide for 10 years now with great success. I truly appreciate how you explain each step you do. This makes it very easy to follow, and also easy to deviate from the guide if desired. Thanks a lot.

- Nicole:

	I used this guide already with my first mail servers I set up 15 years ago (round about, I‚Äôm not quite sure).
	It always worked fine and is a very big help!
	I have Debian servers with 5 ‚Äì 30 users only, including one community project where also newsletters (i.e. many mails) are sent.
	Today I set up my newest mail server and all works fine.
	I want to thank Christoph for his great work and support and hope the guide will never end üôÇ

- Francisco:

	Thank you Christoph.
	I‚Äôve just setup my mail server and i‚Äôm very happy with it. I‚Äôve learned a lot.
